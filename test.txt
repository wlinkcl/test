DDD/MS

Data is often extracted and copied from XML or JSON request structures to meaningful domain objects because these objects tend to be much easier to work with.
Data may be mapped into and out of DTOs through custom code or with data-binding technologies. With the former approach, the logic to move data to and from DTOs may be centralized in the DTO itself, or within Request Mappers and Response Mappers.
